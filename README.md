# cra-express-mysql

This project is an experimentation with full stack configuration of :
NODE, EXPRESS, MYSQL, CREATE REACT APP and other development packages.
The purpose is to learn and create a full-stack for further projects.
You're encourages to critique my work and offer suggestions.

## Available Scripts ### Don't forget to connect up MYSQL DB

In the client directory, run:

### `npm start`

Runs the React front-end in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000]


In the Server directory, run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the Express server in the development mode.<br>
Node server runs on [http://localhost:5000]

## Run concurrently
Server and client can be run with a single command.
In the terminal at the project root directory 'npm start'.

server.js file contains back-end logic to respond to requests and contains simple SQL queries.

## Issues:
Related to hotloading not working.

Expected: Modify front-end or back end files.
          Save file.
          Nodemon updates the backend
          webpack (preconfigured by create-react-app) updates the front-end
          
          
          
### Reproduce/investigate:

1) In terminal: 
                Run the command "npm run dev" from the server folder.
                Run the command "npm start" from the client folder.
                Sometimes at this stage we get the error in step 4.
                
2) Attempt to modify front-end code in client/src/App.js

3) Save file, no change to the page. i.e no hot loading.

4) Refresh browser. The changes in code appear on the page. 

  The console returns these errors:
        
  "Proxy error: Could not proxy request /sockjs-node/574/exhbqd0m/websocket from localhost:3000 to http://localhost:5000/.
  See https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_common_system_errors for more information (ECONNRESET)."
  And in the browser console: 
  "The development server has disconnected. Refresh the page if necessary."</b>

5) This problem seems to be the cause of hot loading not working for the client (create-react-app preconfiguration).
   It's worth noting I think that nodemon does not refresh the browser.
   Modifying back-end logic & saving file restarts the server and a manual page refresh will load all back-end changes so I think it's working ok.
7) If I remove all the express logic for the call and request from server/server.js and client/src/App.js the client hot loading returns.
